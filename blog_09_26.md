# An overview to single view 3D reconstruction based on Deep Learning

#### Yunhao Li, Sep/26/2019

## Description

As a combination of Computer Graphics and Computer Vision, 3D reconstruction has been a classic problem for a long time. In recent years, with the development of the Deep Learning, more and more researchers are focusing on 3D reconstruction with Deep Learning again. 

## Related Work

The number of work focus on 3D reconstruction is increasing recent years. However, unlike classification or object detection, there is not a specific model for 3D reconstruction. That is, their models use different kind of input data, and return different type of output.

### Type of input: 

+ RGB-D images, aka depth image.
+ RGB images.
  + Easy to collect data.
  + Lack depth information(3D information).

### Type of output:

+ Voxel model
  + Easy to implement.
  + Low resolution and high memory consuming.

+ Point cloud
+ Mesh
  + Practical.
  + Hard to implement: Mesh is not tensor. So it is hard to use mini-batch and GPU when training.

## Limitation of single view 3D reconstruction from RGB image.

+ The input files don't include enough information. So it is impossible to reconstruct all the real details of the real object.
+ This procedure is more like a person, who has the knowledge about some object(like, cars). And when he saw a picture of a car, he can easily imagine the 3D details of it. 
+ In a word, it depends on the prior knowledge. 

## Scenario

+ It can save a lot of time when reconstructing a 3D model from a image. People only need to do some tunning to the output model.
+ AR: make the things inside pictures alive.
